      <h2>Walrus Classification and Evolution :</h2>
      <p>
        The Walrus is a large marine animal that is found inhabiting the
        freezing cold and icy waters of the Arctic Circle. Thought to be most
        closely related to Fur Seals, Walruses are the second largest
        ocean-dwelling mammals that come ashore to breed after Elephant Seals
        and are highly distinctive amongst pinnipeds due to their sensitive
        whiskers and long tusks. There are two different species of Walrus that
        vary slightly in appearance but mainly in geographic location which are
        the Atlantic Walrus and the Pacific Walrus. However, it is widely
        debated as to whether or not there is actually a third species known as
        the Laptev Walrus that is found in the Laptev Sea, which many believe to
        simply be a population of Pacific Walruses that specifically inhabit the
        area. The Walrus is considered to be an increasingly vulnerable animal
        species although gathering data on these elusive creatures can be
        difficult so it is hard to determine exactly the current status of
        Walrus populations in the wild.
      </p>
      <h2>Walrus Anatomy and Appearance :</h2>
      <p>
        Walruses are animals with large and elongated bodies that are wider at
        the head and neck and taper towards their tail which is embedded in a
        web of skin. Their tough and wrinkled skin is covered by a layer of
        sparse, coarse hairs and is generally grey or brown in colour. However,
        whilst sunbathing out of the water, the skin of the Walrus (which can be
        up to 4cm thick) develops a pink-red colouration. Walruses have two
        pairs of flippers that are used to help to propel these large animals
        with great agility through the water, with their bodies powered by their
        back flippers while the front flippers are used to steer them in the
        right direction. On land, they move about awkwardly on all fours,
        curling their back flippers underneath them at right angles to give them
        more support. The skin on the bottom of their flippers is rough and
        knobbly which helps to prevent these enormous animals from slipping on
        the ice. Walruses have long tusks (extra-long upper canine teeth) that
        are used for both fighting and to dig into the ice when they are pulling
        their heavy bodies out of the water.
      </p>
      <h2>Walrus Distribution and Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        Walruses are animals that are found throughout the northern Atlantic and
        Pacific Oceans where they inhabit ice floes and rocky coastlines, along
        with spending a great deal of time in the freezing cold water. During
        the winter months when the ice is at its thickest, Walruses tend to
        prefer areas of thinner ice that they can easily break through to the
        surface from the water underneath. In the warmer summer months when the
        ice recedes, Walruses can be found more commonly on remote areas of
        rocky coastline. Despite being well suited to the freezing conditions in
        the far north, Walruses have on occasion been known to venture further
        south in areas of Central Canada, around the United Kingdom and even as
        far as the waters close to the Spanish coast. They do however, spend
        most of their time in and around the Arctic Circle where they are
        becoming increasingly under-threat from global warming which is rapidly
        depleting the ice that these animals have learnt to rely on.
      </p>
      <h2>Walrus Behaviour and Lifestyle :</h2>
      <p>
        Walruses are incredibly sociable animals that live in large herds on the
        ice floes that can contain up to thousands of individuals and consist
        mainly on females (cows) with their young, along with a number of
        dominant males (bulls). When they retreat into the water to feed, these
        enormous herds break up into smaller bands numbering as few as ten
        individuals so there is less competition for food. Male Walruses are
        almost double the weight of their female counterparts and have much
        longer tusks which can grow up to a meter in length and are used
        primarily for fighting with competitors for the most favoured breeding
        sites and the females that reside there. They are known to make a
        variety of vocal sounds including loud bellows during the mating season
        that are easily and loudly produced thanks to the two pouches of air in
        their necks.
      </p>
      <h2>Walrus Reproduction and Life Cycles :</h2>
      <p>
        Walruses most commonly breed in the middle of winter between the months
        of January and March. After a gestation period that lasts for around 15
        months, a single pup is born on the ice measuring up to 1.2 meters long
        and weighing up 75kg. Walrus pups have short and soft hair covering
        their bodies, pale grey flippers and a thick, white moustache with no
        visible teeth. They suckle only on their motherâ€™s milk for their first
        six months when they begin to eat more solid foods. After their first
        year, Walrus pups are almost triple the size they were at birth and
        begin to become more and more independent, although tend to remain very
        close to their incredibly protective mothers until they are two or three
        years old. Young females will often remain close to their mother but
        males begin to venture away from the herd to join all-male bachelor
        groups. Female Walruses are able to reproduce at around 6 or 7 years of
        age but males are not mature until they are at least 10 years old but
        will often not successfully reproduce until they can prove their
        dominance around 5 years later.
