      <h2>Scientific Name :</h2>
      <p>
        The Habu Snake has several common names, including Okinawa Habu and Kume
        Shima. It also has several scientific names. Most often, it is listed as
        Protobothrops flavoviridis. Other sources list it as Trimeresurus
        flavoviridis. Both classifications indicate its relationship to other
        pit vipers. The Latin flavoviridis means “yellowish green” and describes
        the snake’s color. It is of the class Reptilia (reptiles) and the family
        Viperidae (viper snakes).
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically, scientists have struggled to class the Habu Snake
        effectively. Other scientific name synonyms include Bothrops
        flavoviridis, Trimeresurus riukiuanus, and Lachesis flavoviridis. In the
        past, two subspecies were recognized – P. flavoviridis tinkhami and P.
        flavoviridis flavoviridis.
      </p>
      <h2>Population & Conservation Status :</h2>
      <p>
        The total population of these snakes is unknown, but researchers believe
        that the population is in decline. One reason is an observable decrease
        in the number of bites each year. On Okinawajima Island, around 300
        people were bitten by these snakes each year in 1970. By the 1990s, 100
        were bitten each year. In 2015, fewer than 30 bites occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pattern is similar on Amamaioshima Island, where 300 bites per year
        in 1950 dropped to less than 100 bites per year by 2000. The Habu is
        currently rated as an animal of Least Concern by the IUCN Red List of
        Threatened Species. This rating was assigned in 2016.
      </p>
      <h2>Appearance and Description :</h2>
      <p>
        The Habu Snake is a large pit viper; in fact, it is the largest snake in
        its genus. Its average length is 4 to 5 feet, but individuals 7.9 feet
        in length have been observed. This snake has a large head and a slender
        body. Its scales are small. Its background color is brown or olive
        green, with dark green or darker brown blotches on top. The edges of the
        blotches are yellow, and yellow spots may also occur. Often, the
        blotches fuse to form a wavy line down the back. The snake’s belly is
        white with dark edges.
      </p>
      <h2>Habu Snake Venom: How Dangerous Are They?</h2>
      <p>
        The venom of the Habu Snake is highly toxic. It contains hemorrhagic
        components and cytotoxins. The bite causes symptoms such as nausea,
        vomiting, and hypotension (low blood pressure).
      </p>
      <p>
        People do not usually die from Habu Snake bites. However, if you are
        bitten, you should seek medical care immediately. Even after receiving
        treatment, 6 to 8 percent of bite victims suffer permanent disability,
        losing motor function in the hands or legs due to the venom’s effects.
      </p>
      <h2>Habu Snake Behavior and Humans :</h2>
      <p>
        These snakes are aggressive when disturbed, resulting in a relatively
        high number of snake bites. Decades ago, hundreds of people were bitten
        by Habu Snakes each year. Today the numbers are lower – about 2 bites
        per 1,000 people. However, this rate is still considered very high.
        People may encounter Habu snakes when visiting cemeteries or historic
        structures, as the snakes like to rest along rock walls. People may also
        be bitten if they step on the snake, as it is a terrestrial or
        ground-dwelling species. Bites are more likely to occur at night since
        the snake is nocturnal. It may enter homes in search of food sources,
        namely mice or rats.
