      <h2>Oak Toad Scientific Name :</h2>
      <p>
        The oak toad’s scientific name Anaxyrus quercicus species in the
        Bufonidae family. The oak toad’s seen as the smallest toad in North
        America, maxing out at 1.3 inches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quercicusis comes from “quercinus.” That’s Latin for “of oak leaves.”
        It’s a reference to the general pattern and leaf color of the toad.
        Their range extends from Virginia‘s southeast Coastal Plain down to some
        of Florida‘s lower keys.
      </p>
      <h2>Oak Toad Appearance & Behavior :</h2>
      <p>
        The species is small with a max length of a little over one inch. The
        species background color comes in black to gray. The oak toad has a
        conspicuous mid-dorsal that’s white, orange, cream or yellow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Creatures with lighter backgrounds may have several pairs of dark spots
        visible on the backs. The toad’s skin is fine but roughened with
        tubercles. Bottoms of the hind and forefeet are orange-reddish
        tubercles. The animal’s skin is also moist and soft to the touch. The
        male’s vocal sac is either sausage-shaped (when inflated) or oval.
      </p>
      <p>
        The oak toad comes with a short head and pointed nose. It has a short,
        flat, squat body On the back are four to five pairs of dark botches with
        a grayish-white underside. The oak toad has a poisonous teardrop
        parotoid gland. It’s used to fight off predators.
      </p>
      <h2>Oak Toad vs. Frog :</h2>
      <p>
        Frogs and toads are easily mistaken for one another. They’re both green
        and eat similar meals. But they are not the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s start with the face frogs can be twice the size of an oak toad.
        They can grow between 2.4 to 3.5 inches. Frogs have long legs that are
        longer than their bodies and heads. Toads in general have short legs.
        Rather than hopping, this toad tends to crawl.
      </p>
      <p>
        You won’t find frogs and toads in the same habitats. Frogs lose moisture
        easily and are rarely far from bodies of water. Thanks to their skin,
        oak toads are comfortable in dry ecosystems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each baby is also unique. Frog tadpoles are slim while oak toad tadpoles
        will be chunkey. The oak toad baby is plain black while the frog baby
        will be gold-flecked.
      </p>
      <h2>Oak Toad Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        Oak toads love open canopied oak as well as pine forests with ditches
        and temporary ponds. For the most part, you won’t find oak toads in
        areas with permanent water and drained soils. They also have a fondness
        for wet prairies highlighted by short hydroperiods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The animals are comfortable under logs and boards, in shallow
        depressions and burrows surrounded by vegetation like cabbage palms and
        saw palmettos.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the winters, oak toads stay underground in shallow depressions
        and burrows for intermittent intervals. How long they stay will depend
        on ambient temps. During the cold, they also have inhabited under pine
        bark and in rotted oak logs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adult toads are insectivorous. Their fave meal is ants, but the toads
        have no problem munching on aphids, beetles, orthopterans, spiders,
        dipterans, centipedes and mollusks.
      </p>
      <h2>Oak Toad Diet :</h2>
      <p>
        Adult toads are insectivorous. Their fave meal is ants, but the toads
        have no problem munching on aphids, beetles, orthopterans, spiders,
        dipterans, centipedes and mollusks.
      </p>
      <h2>Oak Toad Predators & Threats :</h2>
      <p>
        The oak toad is a small animal with little means for defending itself
        physically. You’re not going to see a lot of YouTube videos of the
        creature fighting off a predator. Nor will you see a lot of predatory
        behavior where the oak toad attacks and kills.
      </p>
      <p>
        But they do have to eat and they do have to survive, just like the rest
        of us.
