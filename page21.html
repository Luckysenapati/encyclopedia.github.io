      <h2>Uakari Classification and Evolution :</h2>
      <p>
        The Uakari is a small species of monkey, native to the tropical
        rainforests of South America, where they tend to be found in moist
        jungle that is close to water. The Uakari is most well-known for its
        naked face which most commonly ranges from pink to deep red in colour.
        There are four distinct species of Uakari, which are the Red (Bald)
        Uakari, the Black-Headed Uakari, the Ayres Black Uakari and the Neblina
        Uakari, all of which are very similar in appearance but differ somewhat
        in fur colour and location. The name Uakari is actually pronounced
        “wakari”, with both this monkey’s common name and its scientific name
        thought to have derived from indigenous languages.
      </p>
      <h2>Uakari Anatomy and Appearance :</h2>
      <p>
        The Uakari is a small sized primate growing to an average of 45cm in
        length, and weighing around 3kg. The tail of the Uakari is very short
        relative to its body size, and particularly small compared to those of
        other South American monkey species. The fur that covers the Uakari’s
        body is long and coarse and tends to vary in colour, from red, to brown,
        to black, to white, depending on the species. The hairless face of the
        Uakari is their most distinctive feature, and can be deep red in colour
        in some individuals (although it generally ranges from pink to red, and
        can be paler or even black in some species). Their hands and feet are
        strong and agile with their opposable thumbs allowing the Uakari to hold
        onto fruits and tree branches.
      </p>
      <h2>Uakari Distribution and Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        The Uakari is found inhabiting moist, tropical rainforest only in the
        Amazon River Basin, throughout Brazil and Peru, and in parts of southern
        Columbia. The separate species tend to be most easily characterised by
        their differing locations, and this is also true for the sub-species of
        the Bald Uakari. The White Uakari is found in north-western Brazil; the
        Golden Uakari on the Brazil-Peru border; the Red Uakari on the
        Brazil-Columbia border, with the Pale-Backed Red Uakari being found just
        a little further east. The Uakari is generally found in jungles that
        fringe fresh water sources such as streams, small rivers and lakes. They
        prefer part-flooded forest that is flooded either permanently or on a
        seasonal basis though, to areas of rainforest that line large rivers.
      </p>
      <h2>Uakari Behaviour and Lifestyle :</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike numerous other monkey species, the Uakari does not use its short
        tail to hang from the trees or to help it when jumping, although it is
        still useful for balance. They spend much of their time high in the
        canopy and jump from tree to tree just using their strong arms and legs.
        Like many primates however, the Uakari is known to walk on all four
        limbs on its rare trips down to the forest floor. The Uakari lives in
        troops in their jungle environment that usually contain between 10 and
        30 members (although they can be up to 100 strong), which are males,
        females and their offspring. Although they spend much of their time
        together in the trees, when it comes to looking for food, the Uakari
        troop breaks up into smaller groups to forage.
      </p>
      <h2>Uakari Reproduction and Life Cycles :</h2>
      <p>
        The Uakari tends to breed between the months of October and May, when
        the females release and attractive scent to attract a mate. Once mated,
        the female Uakari gives birth to a single infant, after a gestation
        period that is still unknown, but she can do so every two years. The
        baby Uakari’s are incredibly small and vulnerable at birth, clinging to
        their mother for their first few months, and feeding only on her milk.
        They are weaned at an average age of four months old when they begin to
        forage with the troop for soft fruits and seed pods. The Uakari tends to
        live for about 20 years in the wild, but population growth rates are not
        particularly fast as the females can’t breed until they are three years
        old, and the males when they are six.
