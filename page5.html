      <h2>Eagle Scientific Name :</h2>
      <p>
        An eagle is a group of particularly large birds that belong to the
        family of Accipitridae (this scientific name is derived from the Latin
        word accipiter, which means hawk). Many different types of birds belong
        to this family, including vultures, kites, and hawks. What distinguishes
        the eagle is its larger size and massive beak.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some 60 species of eagles still living in the world today.
        They can be divided into several main groups: the fish or sea eagles,
        serpent eagles, forest eagles, and booted eagles. These are informal
        groups and not necessarily taxonomical ones. What many Americans may not
        know is that the bald eagle (scientific name Haliaeetus leucocephalus)
        is actually a type of sea eagle.
      </p>
      <h2>Eagle Appearance :</h2>
      <p>
        The eagle is among the largest of all birds; only some condors and
        vultures can rival it in sheer size. The largest species of eagles, such
        as the harpy eagle and Steller‚Äôs sea eagle, weigh up to 20 pounds and
        display a wingspan of around 7 or 8 feet from tip to tip. Females
        actually tend to be larger than males on average, but it‚Äôs not entirely
        clear why; perhaps it‚Äôs to protect the chicks from danger while the male
        is away. In addition to their size, the eagles are further distinguished
        by their sharp, heavy beaks (which end in a downward-sloping point) and
        four big talons on each foot. They also have small projections on the
        bottom of their feet called ‚Äúspicules‚Äù to grasp prey. Unlike the
        scavenging vulture, eagles also have a fully-feathered head, sometimes
        capped off in a luxurious-looking crest.
      </p>
      <h2>Eagle Behavior :</h2>
      <p>
        These birds have exceptional vision that ranks among the best in the
        animal kingdom. Translated into human terms, it would have 20/5 or even
        20/4 eyesight. There are a few reasons for this: the enormous size of
        the pupils, the density of light-detecting cells in the retina, and the
        shape of the fovea (a small pit in the back of the eye which is
        responsible for an animal‚Äôs sharp central vision). This confers enormous
        visual advantages. First, an eagle can see four to eight times farther
        than the average human, allowing it to spot small prey from up to two
        miles away, even while in flight. Second, it can also see in a wider
        range of colors, including ultraviolet. Finally, it can shift focus
        quickly to zoom in on prey. But in order to focus on a specific spot,
        the eagle usually has to turn its entire head in that direction.
        Fortunately, the eagle also has 14 vertebrae in its neck compared to
        only seven for humans, enabling it to a greater degree of rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the bird finally spots prey, it usually swoops down and snatches up
        its unsuspecting victim in its feet and talons. In this action, it acts
        with remarkable speed. The common golden eagle can dive down at speeds
        of around 150 to 200 miles per hour, which is nearly the equal of the
        peregrine falcon, the fastest animal in the world. In flight, the golden
        eagle can only maintain speeds of around 28 to 32 miles per hour, which
        still allows it to cover much of its hunting ground quickly in a day.
        Most of these birds are sedentary (which means they maintain a strict
        territory all-year-round), but a few species and subspecies may
        undertake a partial or full migration for the cold winter months.
      </p>
      <p>
        When several eagles gather together in groups, it is called a
        convocation, congregation, or aerie. But these birds are not really one
        for large social gatherings. Instead, it tends to maintain a very narrow
        family life with a single mate and their chicks. It has little other
        social contacts besides that. Except for the breeding season, many
        eagles don‚Äôt actually make many sounds. The bald eagle is one exception.
        It emits a harsh call to communicate with each other or warn away
        intruders.
      </p>
      <h2>Eagle Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        These birds are found all over the world in almost every single type of
        habitat, from the far northern tundra to tropical rainforests and
        deserts. Only two species, the bald eagle and golden eagle are common to
        North America, while nine species are endemic to Central and South
        America. The Eastern Hemisphere contains the greatest concentration of
        them, particularly in Africa. Many of the islands dotted throughout the
        Indian and Pacific Oceans even have their own distinct species as well.
      </p>
      <h2>Eagle Diet :</h2>
      <p>
        These birds are apex predators in every ecosystem where it‚Äôs found. This
        is specifically reflected in its anatomy: thee birds have a sharp beak
        and talons are specifically adapted for ripping and tearing flesh. It is
        also not shy about scavenging for food left behind or killed by other
        animals. In fact, the bald eagle‚Äôs tendency to steal the kills of other
        birds once prompted Benjamin Franklin to say that it was a bird of ‚Äúbad
        moral character‚Äù (though despite common belief, he did not propose that
        the turkey should be the national symbol of the United States instead).
        These birds are also a feast or famine type of bird since it can
        sometimes go several weeks in between meals. For a complete list of the
        food eagles eat, check out our ‚ÄúWhat Do Eagles Eat‚Äù page.
      </p>
      <h2>What does the eagle eat? :</h2>
      <p>
        These birds‚Äô preferred diet depends mostly on where it lives and what
        it‚Äôs adapted for. The most common prey includes fish, crabs, snakes,
        amphibians, small birds, rodents, and other mammals, sometimes as large
        as a deer or pig. However, these birds rarely just stick to a single
        type of food. Although they may have a single preference (fish eagles
        obviously consume fish), they will also eat a wide selection of other
        foods based on what‚Äôs available at the time. If the meal is too large to
        carry in its talons, then the bird will eat it directly where the animal
        was killed.
      </p>
      <h2>Eagle Predators and Threats :</h2>
      <p>
        Up until the 19th and 20th centuries, these birds have historically
        faced few threats in the wild. But the combined effect of overhunting,
        habitat loss, and pesticide use (which seeped into the environment and
        water) threatened many species with extinction. In places where hunting
        and pesticide use are tightly regulated, eagle numbers are quickly
        recovering.
      </p>
      <h2>Eagle Reproduction, Babies, and Lifespan :</h2>
      <p>
        Following a brief courtship display, which can include an impressive
        aerial performance and synchronized behavior, these birds form
        exceptionally strong bond pairs that mate for life. This allows them to
        create and keep building upon the same nest year after year, usually in
        a high and inaccessible cliff or tree. These nests, which also go by the
        name of eyries, are usually composed out of sticks, moss, lichens, and
        other plant material. However, most of these birds only use the nest
        when they are actually raising their young and abandon it temporarily
        for the rest of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the female lays her eggs, she incubates them for a month or two,
        while the father hunts and provides most of the food. These birds can
        produce anywhere between one and four eggs, but the larger, dominant
        chick may end up killing or out-competing the smaller one. While this
        may seem cruel, it is an effective strategy for ensuring that one chick
        almost always survives, especially since mortality rates are already
        quite high among the young.
