      <h2>Babirusa Scientific Name :</h2>
      <p>
        Babyrousa celebensis is the scientific name for the babirusa. This type
        of babirusa is also known as the North Sulawesi babirusa. The Malaysian
        word babirusa translates to deer-pig. They have the appearance of a
        swine as well as antlers like a deer. They belong to the Suidae family
        and the Mammalia class.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are four species of babirusa. Besides the North Sulawesi babirusa
        there are the:

      <h2>Babirusa Appearance & Behavior :</h2>
      <p>
        Babirusas have brown or grayish skin with a sparse amount of hair on
        their body. Their long, rounded body has been compared to the shape of a
        torpedo! Plus, they have slender legs similar to those of a deer. These
        mammals can grow to a height of two to three feet and can be three to
        three and a half feet long. Furthermore, they can weigh from 132 to 220
        pounds. A three-foot-tall babirusa is equal in height to two and a half
        bowling pins stacked on top of each other. A 220-pound babirusa is equal
        in weight to two-thirds of an adult panda bear. Out of all the species
        of babirusa, the North Sulawesi babirusa is the heaviest at 220 pounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most well-known feature of this mammal is its tusks. It has two
        tusks on the lower half of its snout and two on the upper half. Though
        they are called tusks, they are actually canine teeth. On its upper
        snout, the babirusaâ€™s canine teeth grow, break through the skin and
        curve upward and back toward the babirusaâ€™s eyes. In fact, these curving
        teeth (tusks) can grow so long, they can actually penetrate the skull of
        this animal eventually causing death.
      </p>
      <h2>Babirusa Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        They live on islands in Indonesia including Togian, Sula, Buru, and
        Sulawesi. Wild babirusas donâ€™t live anywhere else in the world except on
        these islands. These mammals live in a moist, tropical climate in swamps
        and in rainforests, near rivers. They take shelter in the underbrush and
        in canebrakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        These swine roll around in the mud in order to cool themselves in this
        humid climate. This is also an effective way to get rid of any parasites
        on their skin. Another interesting behavior of these swine is called
        plowing. A male babirusa lowers itself to its knees and pushes its nose
        through the sandy ground. The babirusa has its mouth open and takes in
        the sand while releasing foaming saliva. This is strange behavior that
        scientists havenâ€™t fully figured out. But they think plowing may be a
        way for a babirusa to mark its territory with its scent.
      </p>
      <h2>Babirusa Predators and Threats :</h2>
      <p>
        These animals are omnivores. Oftentimes, they use their hooves to dig in
        the ground in search of insects or larvae. They can stand on their back
        hooves supporting their body in order to eat leaves off the lower
        branches of a tree.
