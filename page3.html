      <h2>Cactus Moth Species, Types, and Scientific Name :</h2>
      <p>
        They belong to the Pyralidae family of moths and are part of the
        Lepidoptera order. Lepidoptera includes all moths and butterflies. Like
        all other moths, cactus moths are most active at night. They can be hard
        to spot due to their coloring and that they are most active after the
        sun has gone down. They have four wings, which they keep extended around
        their bodies while at rest. In contrast, butterflies fold their wings
        vertically when resting.
      </p>
      <h2>Appearance :</h2>
      <p>
        Cactus moths arenâ€™t all that exciting to look at, unfortunately for
        people trying to spot them in the wild. This helps the cactus moths
        blend into their surroundings, however. Adult cactus moths are
        brownish-gray. They have four wings: two forewings and two hindwings.
        Cactus moths do not have any distinctive markings on their wings or
        bodies. They do have two antennae and are similar in appearance to other
        moths in the Cactoblasis genus.
      </p>
      <h2>Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        One of the best clues that you can find to tell you if you are looking
        at a cactus moth is to consider its habitat. Cactus moths lay their eggs
        in the flat leaves of cacti. The larvae then consume the cacti as a
        parasite. In their native South America, the cactus moth population is
        kept in check by their natural predators. Ants and New World Monkeys eat
        the larvae. This keeps them from reproducing and becoming invasive.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other places where cactus moths have been introduced, these natural
        predators do not exist. Cactus moths larvae are free to infest and kill
        off cacti without any checks and balances. Female cactus moths lay their
        fertilized eggs directly onto cacti. When they turn into larvae, these
        little guys and gals consume the cactus leaves, fruit, and eventually
        enough of the plant to kill it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cactus moths were actually introduced to Australia and later the
        Caribbean and South Africa to help control the cacti population. They
        had quite a bit of success, especially in Australia. They soon became
        invasive in some areas, however.
      </p>
      <h2>How Cactus Moths Spread :</h2>
      <p>
        Some cactus moth expansion was planned, such as that in Australia. The
        spread of cactus moths to other areas occurs when infested cacti are
        transported. The moths can also be moved by human dispersal and
        livestock dispersal. Areas where cactus moths pose a serious threat to
        the natural ecosystem, such as the Southwestern United States, track
        cactus moth infestations very closely. They encourage residents with
        infestations to get them treated right away.
      </p>
      <h2>Diet :</h2>
      <p>
        Cactus moth larvae eat cacti plants. They are a parasite on these
        plants, consuming them to the point where the plant dies. Cactus moths
        are very destructive to cacti, especially prickly pear cactus. In areas
        where certain species of cacti became invasive, cactus moths provided a
        great natural way to keep the cactus population under control.
      </p>
      <p>
        As they were brought out of their natural habitat to other areas,
        however, cactus moths continued to look for cacti. They are now found in
        Florida, South Carolina, Texas, and the Southwest. In these areas, their
        preferred food, the prickly pear cactus, is also a valuable part of the
        ecosystem for other animals. Food is scarce in some areas, especially
        deserts, and without the prickly pear cactus, other species are in
        significant danger. For this reason, the cactus moth is considered an
        invasive species in some areas. Pest treatments and controls help keep
        these moths from infesting cacti that are needed.
