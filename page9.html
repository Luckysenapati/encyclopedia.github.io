      <h2>Ibex Appearance :</h2>
      <p>
        Most species of these animals have a brown or gray coat. The exact shade
        and thickness are determined by where they live. For example, the Nubian
        species have a shiny coat that reflects the sun and helps them keep
        cool. Nubian ibex are smaller than other species and have slimmer horns.
        The alpine ibex is a typical example of the species. Adult males weigh
        around 220 pounds and stand about three feet at the shoulder. Females
        are about four inches shorter and weigh about half as much at 110
        pounds. Males have long horns that curl over their backs. The horns are
        strongly ridged on the front. Males also have beards.
      </p>
      <h2>Ibex Behavior :</h2>
      <p>
        These animals typically socialize in gender-specific herds. This means
        that there are male herds and female herds. The male herds are often
        called bachelor herds. The two herds only meet up during breeding
        seasons. Sometimes, older males will wander alone without a herd. Female
        herds usually have 10 to 20 animals. The animal will usually flee from
        people, but if itâ€™s rutting season males can be particularly aggressive
        and might charge.
      </p>
      <h2>Ibex Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        These animals live primarily in high mountain regions and tall cliffs.
        These habitats make it difficult for predators to get to the animal. The
        Walia species lives in the highest reaches of the Ethiopian highlands at
        elevations of up to 14,800 feet. The Nubian ibex is found in the hills
        around the Red Sea and the Egyptian highlands. The alpine species is
        found mainly in the European Alps. They can be found in countries like
        France, Austria, Germany, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Italy, and Switzerland.
        The Iberian or Spanish ibex lives mainly in the southern Pyrenees on the
        Iberian Peninsula. It was previously found all through the Pyrenees and
        in the south of France. The Pyrenean ibex is a subspecies of the Iberian
        species, and it became extinct by the year 2000. The Pyrenean ibex was
        later cloned in 2009, but the specimen only lived for ten minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Siberian or Asiatic ibex is often considered a subspecies of the
        alpine species, but it may be a distinct species. It enjoys a wide
        distribution from Afghanistan to Mongolia. The animals are typically
        found at elevations as high as 5,300 meters above sea level. The
        Caucasian ibex is also known as the Caucasian tur, and it is found in
        the Caucasus. The hoof structure of the animal makes it very nimble and
        skilled at climbing steep rocks. Despite living high in the mountains,
        they tend to avoid deep snow.
      </p>
      <h2>Ibex Diet :</h2>
      <p>
        All of these animals are herbivores. They only eat vegetation like
        bushes, grasses, and shrubs. Vegetation high in the mountains tends to
        have low nutritional value, so the animal spends much of its day eating
        and grazing. Some of them will also climb into the lower branches of
        trees to eat leaves. As the animal avoids deep snow, they may come down
        from the steep elevations in the winter to find food. Herds tend to make
        sure that their range includes a dependable water source.
      </p>
      <h2>Ibex Predators and threats :</h2>
      <p>
        The animalâ€™s best defense against predators is its ability to climb to
        steep heights. Very few predators can follow them up the steep cliffs
        and mountains. A threatened animal may rear on its hind legs and point
        its horns towards the threat. Young animals are susceptible to being
        carried off by large birds of prey such as eagles.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the start of the 19th century, the animalâ€™s population was quickly
        dwindling. It was often hunted for superstitious reasons. A century of
        aggressive protection followed, and now many species of these animals
        are thriving. Currently, the only species near extinction are the
        Ethiopian and the Spanish ibex. The Pyrenean subspecies became extinct
        in the year 2000.
      </p>
      <h2>Ibex Reproduction and Life Cycle :</h2>
      <p>
        The breeding season for these animals starts in late autumn to early
        winter. The males leave their bachelor herds to find females. Males
        often fight with other males to determine who can breed with the
        females. Despite the large horns of the animals, itâ€™s rare for males to
        sustain serious damage from fights. Once the female becomes pregnant,
        the gestation period is about six months. Most young are born around
        May. These animals usually have one kid per litter. Itâ€™s possible for
        the ibex to have twins and even triplets, but the latter is very rare.
        Twins make up about 20% of births.
      </p>
      <p>
        The babies are called kids, and they reach sexual maturity at about 18
        months. They are often left alone when young to hide from predators. How
        long they stay alone depends on how quickly they pick up handling the
        terrain. The young usually stay with their mothers for at least a year.
        However, females do not reach their full body size until about five or
        six years of age, and males donâ€™t reach it until nine to 11 years. The
        animalâ€™s horns keep growing throughout their life. These animals can
        live up to 20 years in the wild.
