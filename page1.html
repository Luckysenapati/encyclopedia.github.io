      <h2>Aardvark Classification and Evolution :</h2>
      <p>
        Aardvarks are small pig-like mammals that are found inhabiting a wide
        range of different habitats throughout Africa, south of the Sahara. They
        are mostly solitary and spend their days sleeping in underground burrows
        to protect them from the heat of the African sun, emerging in the cooler
        evening to search for food. Their name originates from the Afrikaans
        language in South Africa and means Earth Pig, due to their long snout
        and pig-like body. Aardvarks are unique among animals as they are the
        only surviving species in their animal family. Until recently it was
        widely believed that they were most closely related to other
        insectivores such as armadillos and pangolins but this is not the case
        with their closest living relatives actually thought to be elephants.
      </p>
      <h2>Aardvark Anatomy and Appearance :</h2>
      <p>
        Aardvarks have a unique appearance amongst mammals (and indeed all
        animals) as they display physical characteristics of a number of
        different animal species. They have medium-sized, almost hairless bodies
        and long snouts that make them look distinctly pig-like at first, with
        thick skin that both protects them from the hot sun and also from being
        harmed by insect bites. They are able to close their nostrils to stop
        dust and insects from entering their nose. They have tubular,
        rabbit-like ears that can stand on end but can also be folded flat to
        prevent dirt from entering them when they are underground. Aardvarks
        have strong, claws on each of their spade-like feet that along with the
        fact that their hind legs are longer than their front legs, makes them
        strong and capable diggers able to excavate vast amounts of earth at an
        alarming rate. Due to the fact that they spend most of their lives
        underground or out hunting in the dark at night, they have poor eyesight
        but are able to easily navigate their surrounding using their excellent
        sense of smell to both find prey and to sense potential danger.
      </p>
      <h2>Aardvark Distribution and Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        Aardvarks are found in a wide variety of different habitats throughout
        sub-Saharan Africa from dry deserts to the moist rainforest regions. The
        only stipulation (other than having good access to plenty of food and
        water) is to have good soil in which they can dig their extensive
        burrows. Despite being highly skilled at digging in sandy or clay soil
        types, rockier regions prove more of a challenge to create their
        underground homes so the aardvark will move to another area where soil
        conditions are better suited to digging. Their burrows can be up to 10
        meters (33 ft) long in a home range that can be anywhere from 2 to 5
        kilometres square. Their burrows often having multiple entrances and are
        always left head first so they are able to identify potential predators
        easily using their keen sense of smell.
