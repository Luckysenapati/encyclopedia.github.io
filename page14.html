      <h2>Naked Mole Rat Scientific name :</h2>
      <p>
        The naked mole rat’s scientific name is Heterocephalus glaber.
        Heterocephalus means “two-headed” or “different-headed” in Greek and is
        used to describe a deformed fetus with two unequal heads as well as the
        genus the naked mole rat belongs to. It is possible that such a
        deformity occurred to the scientist who first took a look at the
        odd-looking animal. “Glaber” is Latin for smooth and hairless, though
        the skin of the naked mole rat is wrinkled and has no layer of fat
        beneath it. The naked mole rat is the only species in its genus.
      </p>
      <h2>Naked Mole Rat Appearance :</h2>
      <p>
        The naked mole rat is a small rodent with a cylindrical body and pinkish
        skin that’s almost completely hairless, though there are tiny, sensitive
        hairs over the body that let it know where it is in the darkness of its
        burrow. The mole rat also has hairs between its toes that let it sweep
        back soil. There’s no insulating fat beneath the skin. Males and females
        are about the same size, though breeding males and the queen are larger.
        It has a tail of medium length, short legs, and proportionally large
        feet made for digging.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the naked mole rat lives most of its life in an underground burrow
        devoid of light, sight is useless, and its eyes are nearly vestigial,
        though they have thickened eyelids that keep the dirt out of them. The
        rodents have prominent, chisel-like teeth that identify them as rodents.
        They use these teeth, which can move independently of each other like
        scissors or chopsticks, to help them dig through the ground. An array of
        muscles make sure that the animal’s mouth remains closed behind its
        teeth so it doesn’t swallow the soil. Indeed, much of the somatosensory
        cortex in the sand puppy’s brain is dedicated to its teeth.
      </p>
      <h2>Naked Mole Rat Behavior :</h2>
      <p>
        Since a sand puppy colony can’t distinguish day from night, it is active
        at all hours. Non-breeding mole rats do the work of the colony. They
        raise the pups after they’ve been weaned, find food, protect the borrow
        and build molehills. As with certain types of bees and wasps, younger
        members take care of the young while older members serve as soldiers.
        The queen and breeding males do nothing much but procreate. The queen,
        who rather bullies all the other mole rats in her burrow, is always fed
        first. She produces hormones to suppress the reproduction of other
        females, and if she dies, older females in the colony will fight for
        dominance. Sometimes they fight to the death, and the winner takes over
        the colony.
      </p>
      <p>
        When constructing the burrow, the animals form a line where the first
        one digs with its teeth, and the others push the loosened soil down to
        the last, who then deposits it above ground, building a molehill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every naked mole rat burrow has its own odor. This allows the members,
        who can’t see well, to tell their family members from strangers.
        Colonies also have their own vocalizations that warn of danger and let
        family members tell each other apart in the darkness. Naked mole rats
        need to huddle together to keep warm while they sleep, and they sleep on
        their backs. They also climb up into chambers closer to the surface that
        is warmed by the sun.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naked mole rats live exponentially longer than other rodents. It is not
        unheard of for a mole rat to live 30 years or more, while the lifespan
        of a mouse is about three years. Moreover, they do not seem to age. No
        one can really say why, though their DNA is able to repair itself over
        time far more effectively than the DNA of mice.
      </p>
      <h2>Naked Mole Rat Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        Naked mole rats build their burrows and tunnels in the savannas and
        grasslands of east African countries such as Kenya, Somalia, and
        Ethiopia, though they’re also found in Tanzania and Uganda. The tunnels
        are about 6.5 feet deep, and since they branch off into other tunnels
        and chambers that serve as larders, toilets, and nests, they can be 2.5
        miles long. Naked mole rat colonies are found in elevations of between
        3608 and 9843 feet above sea level. Because they build their colonies in
        places that are of no agricultural interest to people, naked mole rats
        are largely left to themselves. Their strangeness also protects them,
        and they contribute greatly to Kenya’s ecotourism. They also live in
        zoos and protected areas.
      </p>
      <h2>Naked Mole Rat Diet :</h2>
      <p>
        These animals feed on the underground parts of plants, such as tubers,
        rhizomes, bulbs, and roots. Some of these structures are very large and
        can feed a colony for years. The animals do not eat all of these
        underground structures but take some back to the burrow for storage.
        This allows the part of the plant to regenerate and for the colony to
        have food if the path to the plant is blocked. Blockages can occur if
        the soil becomes wet. The animal can digest the cellulose in its food
        thanks to bacteria found in its gut. Since they get all their water from
        their food, they don’t need to drink.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, it must be said, these animals ingest their own feces. They
        also give feces to recently weaned pups. Scientists believe this action,
        called coprophagy, helps strengthen the bonds between family members.
        The hormones found in the feces of the queen, for example, may suppress
        the reproductive hormones of other female naked mole rats.
