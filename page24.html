      <h2>Xerus Scientific Name :</h2>
      <p>
        Commonly known as the Xerus, these animals go by the scientific name of
        Xerus erythropus and belong to the family Sciuridae and phylum Chordate.
        They come from the Mammalia animal class. The Xerus has four subspecies.
        The first, the cape ground squirrel (scientific name: Xerus inauris),
        primarily lives in South Africa, Botswana, and Namibia, seeking out
        drier areas to call home. The striped ground squirrel (scientific name:
        Xerus erythropus), however, is found primarily in the southwestern area
        of Morocco, Mauritania, and Senegal.
      </p>
      <h2>Xerus Appearance and Behavior :</h2>
      <p>
        These squirrels are covered in fur from head to toe which is often the
        light-brownish color of the soil. However, it can also be found in
        reddish-grey or yellowish-grey fur. However, their feet have relatively
        lesser hair than the rest of their bodies. While the pads of their feet
        have minimum to no hair, the foot itself has some hair.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of the striped ground squirrel, the body has a white stripe
        running on both sides and shoulders. The tail is usually flat and is a
        darker shade than the body fur. The ears of the animal are usually small
        and the claws are long and curved. However, these claws do not allow the
        creature to climb trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their height can be anywhere between 17 to 18 inches, excluding the
        tail. The tail is about 7.5 to 10.2 inches long, making it approximately
        one-third of the Xerusâ€™ full length. However, the size of the squirrel
        usually and mostly depends on the subspecies in question as all four
        could have some differences. They usually weigh about 14 ounces. These
        squirrels use their tails as protection from the scorching heat.
      </p>
      <h2>Xerus Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        The Xerus are known to live in open areas, especially woodland, desert,
        or grassland. However, they can be found throughout Africa. One of the
        subspecies even makes its home in rocky regions, including the
        mountains. While they are terrestrial, their diurnal habits allow them
        to explore much of the area that they reside in for food.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though many other squirrels and similar animals are known to live in
        trees, Xerus make their home in burrows instead. To find any of these
        animals in the wild, check out certain areas of the desert in South
        Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, and Botswana. The squirrels are not known to
        migrate, so the odds of seeing one are fairly high.
      </p>
      <h2>Xerus Diet :</h2>
      <p>
        Xerus dines on a variety of foods like nuts, roots, and seeds. The cape
        ground squirrel particularly likes shrubs and bulbs as well. They also
        will consume yams, cotton, cassava, peanuts, and sweet potatoes when
        they find them. Though the Xerus is primarily an herbivore, there are
        several animal-based sources of protein that they will seek out during
        their diurnal treks for food. When available and needed, their diet will
        also consist of insects, eggs, and small animals (in small amounts).
      </p>
      <h2>Xerus Predators and Threats :</h2>
      <p>
        Like all the other animals, Xerus also eat and are eaten by other living
        creatures, holding their own in the food chain. The largest threat to
        the life of Xerus is the jackal, though the black-backed jackal seeks it
        out the most. Xerus is also pursued by snakes, lizards, and the puff
        adder. Xerus is known to be a fast animal, which is necessary to beat
        the animals that prey on them. However, it is unclear how quickly that
        they may move, since their quick sprints are often short-lived.
