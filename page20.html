      <h2>Taco Terrier Common Health Issues :</h2>
      <p>
        Although hybrid dogs are usually healthier than their purebred
        ancestors, both of the taco terrierâ€™s purebred breeds have a handful of
        health concerns that need to be addressed. Your taco terrier may be
        susceptible to heart problems, patellar luxation in the knees, eye
        problems, and a variety of other issues. Make sure to take your taco
        terrier puppy to the vet as soon as you bring them home. While youâ€™re
        there, ask the doctor to check for:
      </p>
      <h2>Taco Terrier Temperament :</h2>
      <p>
        Taco terriers are incredibly loyal dogs that like to keep watch over
        their household. Expect your little guard dog to watch the windows and
        bark at strangers whenever they walk past. These dogs have energetic and
        attentive personalities; they love to watch television, listen in on
        family conversations, and generally make themselves part of their
        ownerâ€™s business. Because theyâ€™re so small, itâ€™s common for pet owners
        to bring their taco terrier with them everywhere they go. These little
        dogs make great lap pets and love to be held for extended periods of
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When relaxed, taco terriers love to play and will either chew on toys or
        roll around on the floor. Expect your terrier to display possessive
        behavior traits, especially if another dog is visiting. Because they
        experience high levels of separation anxiety, itâ€™s not a good idea to
        let your taco terrier out of your sight. However, if they know that
        their owner is in the room, these dogs become incredibly playful
        companions that the entire family will love.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Take Care of a Taco Terrier :</h2>
      <p>
        Taco terriers are vibrant and attentive dogs that always seem to be
        involved in the conversation. Keep your taco terrier close by your side,
        and make sure to keep an eye on them when other pets are around. These
        dogs love to sit on their ownerâ€™s lap and will always have an opinion
        about strangers. As long as you spend time with them and give them
        plenty of exercise, your taco terrier will be your best friend for many
        years to come.
      </p>
      <h2>The Best Dog Food for Taco Terriers :</h2>
      <p>
        Taco terriers are small dogs that do not need very much food. Look for a
        high-quality kibble that is intended for small dogs. Then, feed about
        1/2 cup portion twice a day; remember to consult your vet to make sure
        that this amount is correct for your terrierâ€™s size and weight.
        Alternatively, you can make homemade dog food with lean meat and
        vegetables. Again, ensure that the portions are small, and reduce the
        amount that you are feeding if your dog starts gaining weight or seems
        to have too much energy to burn. Dogs who get hypoglycemia should get a
        solid meal ninety minutes plus before exercising so their blood sugar
        doesnâ€™t dip too low.
      </p>
      <p>
        With dogs like Taco Terriers that are prone to hard conditions, itâ€™s
        probably safer to opt for a legume-free food due to the link between
        heart failure and legumes in dog food.
      </p>
      <h2>Taco Terriers and Children :</h2>
      <p>
        Taco terriers make great lap dogs, but they are not a good choice for
        families with children. These small dogs need a lot of attention and
        donâ€™t do well around small kids who do not understand boundaries. Far
        too many taco terriers end up at animal rescues because their families
        were not prepared to give them the attention they need. Only bring home
        one of these dogs if youâ€™re prepared to watch them constantly and take
        them with you when you leave the house.
