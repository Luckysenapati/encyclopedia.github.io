      <h2>Raccoon Scientific Name :</h2>
      <p>
        The scientific name of the raccoon is Procyon lotor. Procyon is a Greek
        term that roughly means ‚Äúbefore the dog‚Äù or ‚Äúdog-like‚Äù (it also happens
        to be the name of a very bright star in the constellation Canis Minor).
        The species scientific name lotor roughly translates from Latin to the
        washer, referring to the raccoon‚Äôs unusual behavior of dipping its food
        in the water.
      </p>
      <p>
        To most people in North America, the word raccoon brings to mind only a
        single species, the common or northern raccoon, but there are two other
        species in the genus: the South American raccoon and the Cozumel
        raccoon. Although similar in appearance, they do exhibit some subtle
        differences. The Cozumel raccoon (also known as the pygmy raccoon, due
        to its smaller size) has a black throat band and a golden yellow tail.
        For the sake of identification, it‚Äôs sufficient to know that the common
        raccoon is the only species endemic to North America.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are more than 20 recognized subspecies of the common raccoon,
        including specific Florida, Texas, Baja California, and Snake River
        Valley variants. Many other subspecies are island specific and don‚Äôt
        interbreed with other populations. Each one varies slightly in skull
        structure, teeth formula, and fur.
      </p>
      <h2>Raccoon Appearance :</h2>
      <p>
        These animals are one of the most recognizable animals in North America.
        It has a pointed snout, a wide skull, rounded ears, sharp teeth, a big
        hunched back (as a result of the hind legs being bigger than the front
        legs), and a bushy tail with four to 10 black rings. The most
        distinctive characteristics are the black markings around the eyes that
        resemble a mask (though not every raccoon has this). The purpose of this
        mask is not entirely known. It might help the raccoons identify each
        other. Or it might enhance the raccoon‚Äôs night vision. Or maybe it
        evolved simply due to random chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of the animal‚Äôs coat consists of dense gray underfur to insulate it
        from the cold. Almost all raccoons have the same general color, but an
        all or mostly white albino variant does exist in nature. There is only
        about a one in 10,000 chance that an albino raccoon will be born and an
        even smaller chance they will survive long in the wild since the white
        color makes them stand out to predators. The elusive albino raccoon is
        so rare that each new report of one draws a lot of attention. In 2019, a
        Windsor photographer snapped a picture of two albinos together in the
        same family. This was estimated to be a one in 750,000 chance meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Raccoons are animals that average between 2 and 3 feet long from tail to
        the skull and weigh between 14 and 23 pounds, about the size of a small
        dog. The male boar is slightly larger than the female sow by about 10 to
        30%. But regardless of sex, their body weight fluctuates widely
        throughout the year. They grow fatter in the winter and slimmer in the
        summer.
      </p>
      <h2>Raccoon Behavior :</h2>
      <p>
        Aided by its excellent night vision and keen eyes, the raccoon is a
        nocturnal predator that comes out at night to feast. It spends the
        remaining daytime asleep in its resident rock crevices, hollow trees,
        and dens, rarely leaving the immediate area unless food is unavailable.
        Unlike many other mammals, raccoons remain largely active during the
        winter seasons, when they live off their body fat, sometimes losing up
        to half their weight before the arrival of spring. Obviously, the
        northern-most populations must pack on the most pounds to survive the
        harsh winter.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the underappreciated aspects of the animal is its surprising
        agility. On the ground, it can run at speeds up to 15 miles per hour to
        evade slower predators. They are also excellent swimmers (though lacking
        in waterproof fur, it spends only a limited amount of time in the
        water). And with the dexterous hands, they can clamber up trees and then
        leap to the ground from a distance of 40 feet without being harmed. This
        appears to provide a means of escape when the raccoon is under
        significant threat. In 2018, a particularly ambitious raccoon scaled the
        UBS tower in St. Paul, Minnesota, offering a showcase of the raccoon‚Äôs
        amazing abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a popular misconception that the raccoon is a solitary animal.
        But after close observation, it was revealed that they do appear to have
        a limited social life that revolves around gender-specific groups. When
        living space becomes tight, multiple animals will share a common area
        and meet regularly to feed and rest. They aren‚Äôt very vocal, except in
        the relationship between mother and kits, but it does have a set of
        harsh screams, hisses, growls, and snarls to warn away other animals.
      </p>
      <h2>Raccoon Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        The raccoon is endemic to a large temperate and tropical habitat
        stretching between southern Canada and the northern part of South
        America, though it was later introduced into new habitats like Japan and
        Europe. These extremely adaptable creatures can thrive in woodlands,
        grasslands, suburban, and even urban areas; almost anywhere with enough
        water and some trees or other large structures for protection.
      </p>
      <h2>Raccoon Diet and Predators :</h2>
      <p>
        The raccoon‚Äôs diet can best be described as opportunistic, varying from
        one location to another based on food availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The raccoon prefers a plant-based diet consisting of seeds, berries,
        nuts, and tubers. It will supplement this with fish, insects, eggs,
        crustaceans, and other small birds and mammals it finds in the water,
        snatches from nests, or uncovers in small holes and crevices. The
        raccoon can be a bit of a pest since it will also raid gardens, trash
        cans, pet food, and any other morsels left around unprotected. The
        raccoon handles the food with its hands and chews with its sharp teeth.
