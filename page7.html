      <h2>Where To Find the Gaboon Viper :</h2>
      <p>
        Gaboon vipers are found in sub-Saharan Africa in habitats that are moist
        and warm. The patterns formed by their colorful scales allow them to
        camouflage in the duff and are an aid in the identification of the
        reptile.
      </p>
      <h2>Gaboon Viper Scientific Name :</h2>
      <p>
        The snakeâ€™s scientific name is Bitis gabonica. The species name refers
        to the Gabon estuary found in the country of the same name or the
        northern part of what was then the French Congo.
      </p>
      <h2>The Different Types of Gaboon Viper?</h2>
      <p>
        For a while, scientists believed that the gaboon viper had a subspecies
        called Bitis gabonica rhinoceros. It was then discovered that B. g.
        rhinoceros was a separate species, and now it is referred to simply as
        B. rhinoceros.
      </p>
      <h2>How To Identify Gaboon Viper: Appearance and Description :</h2>
      <p>
        Identification of this ambush predator is easy because no snake looks
        quite like it. Its upper body is made up of beautiful diamonds,
        triangles, and hourglasses in neutral colors that mimic the colors of
        leaf litter. There are bars running down the back in the shape of
        lozenges. The scales on its back are beautifully keeled, and its belly
        is whitish and bears black or brown patches. The snakeâ€™s neck is narrow,
        but its head is massive, broad, and shaped like a leaf. It is white or
        cream-colored with a thin dark line down the center. Like many members
        of Bitis, it has horns between its nostrils. Thereâ€™s a patch of dark
        brown behind and below each eye, and the eyes themselves are small and
        have a silvery sheen and cat-like irises. The snake also differs from
        others in that its eyes have a surprising range of movement. One eye can
        look forward while the other looks backward. Though the look of the
        snake is breathtaking when it is out in the open, its colors and
        patterns make it very hard to see as it waits for prey among fallen
        leaves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another aid in the identification of the snake is the fact that it is,
        frankly, fat. The heaviest venomous snake on the African continent, the
        gaboon viper can have a weight of over 45 pounds. Females are especially
        hefty. The size of the animal causes it to move slowly, but it only has
        to move fast when it strikes. When it does strike it holds on. This is
        different from other venomous snakes that strike, pull back, and wait
        for their prey to die. That the gaboon viper has 2 inch long fangs helps
        it hold on to its dinner. The fangs are so long that they have to be
        folded back into the reptileâ€™s mouth, and it has to sort of rearrange
        its jaws to make sure they fit comfortably.
      </p>
      <h2>Gaboon Viper Behavior and Humans :</h2>
      <p>
        Gaboon vipers are nocturnal, which means they are active at night. This
        is another reason why bites by these snakes are rare. At sundown, they
        come out of their hiding place and find a location to simply wait for
        prey. Then, like an ambush predator, it strikes, holds on to the prey
        until it at least stops struggling then swallows it whole. Grown vipers
        have no predators themselves, but younger ones are sometimes taken by
        brave secretary birds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The snake most likely mates during the rainy season. Males fight each
        other for the right to mate, decorously. Theyâ€™ll strike with their
        mouths shut and take breaks between rounds. The fight ends when the
        winner pins the loserâ€™s head to the ground and raises his own. Female
        gaboon vipers are gravid for about seven months, then can give birth to
        anywhere between 20 and 50 babies at one time. After that, she takes no
        more care of them. Though biologists arenâ€™t entirely sure of the viperâ€™s
        lifespan, some believe the lifespan can be as long as 20 years. Like
        other snakes, gaboon vipers are helpful to humans because they get rid
        of pests. However, their venom makes them dangerous. Despite this, they
        are often used as bushmeat.
