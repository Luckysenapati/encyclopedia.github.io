      <h2>Quagga Scientific name :</h2>
      <p>
        †Equus quagga quagga is the scientific name for these animals. The
        quagga is in the Mammalia class, and it belongs to the Equidae family.
        There is only one species. The name “quagga” is an onomatopoeia, or
        imitation of the sound made by the animal. The call, as described by
        South Africans, is a “kwa-ha-ha” sound. The pronunciation of the word
        “quagga” uses a short “A” sound. The first part of the word is
        pronounced like “flag.” The correct pronunciation of quagga is
        “kwag-uh.”
      </p>
      <h2>Quagga Appearance :</h2>
      <p>
        The animal’s appearance was fairly similar to a zebra, but it had
        distinguishable traits. Its appearance has also been commonly compared
        to a horse. It had elongated legs, and the tail had long hair on the
        end. The legs were incredibly strong and were made for walking long
        distances and running from predators. They could reach speeds of 40
        miles per hour. They could also use their legs to deliver a powerful
        defensive kick. Like all ungulates, they had hooves. Hooves are very
        tough and it would be quite painful to be kicked by one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fur color was white to brown and had dark brown or black stripes.
        The stripe pattern on the animal was not the same as other zebra
        species. The stripes did not cover the entire body as they do on other
        zebras. They would fade out or stop somewhere below the neck or
        shoulders. The typical length of the animal was about 257 centimeters or
        101 inches. That is almost eight-and-a-half feet long. The height was 49
        to 53 inches, which is three-quarters as tall as a refrigerator. Its
        weight ranged between 250 and 300 kilograms (551-661 pounds). The
        maximum weight of the animal is as heavy as two panda bears. An adult
        panda weighs about 150 pounds on average.
      </p>
      <h2>Quagga Behavior :</h2>
      <p>
        Since they were not largely studied until after their extinction date in
        the 19th century, there is insufficient information on the behavior of
        these animals. It has been noted that they were highly social animals.
        They lived in large herds, or harems and would migrate in groups to
        feed. While some animals migrate for the winter, they did not. They
        traveled daily rather than migrating for a specific season.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the daytime, they would travel to plains or pastures with longer
        grass to feed on. In the middle of the day, along their trek, they would
        pause to drink water from nearby streams or other water sources. They
        would walk back to the area of shorter grass where they would spend
        their nights. The lower grass plains were more open and made it harder
        for predators to hide, giving them a better chance to sleep safely. One
        member of the harem would always keep an eye out for danger while the
        rest of the herd rested overnight.
      </p>
      <h2>Quagga Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        These animals lived exclusively on the continent of Africa. They were
        native to South Africa precisely. They were abundant in Orange Free
        State and in Cape Province, especially in the Karoo region. The karoo is
        an expansive desert shrubland subregion of South Africa that ranges
        across Northern, Eastern, and Western Cape provinces. They inhabited
        arid and temperate climates. The animals would spend their lives in
        grassland and savanna habitats. These grazers were found in pastures and
        plains where there would be plenty of grass to feed on.
      </p>
      <h2>Quagga Diet :</h2>
      <p>
        These animals were migratory grazers. Their diet was not particularly
        fascinating because they only ate one type of food. They were not
        predators to any animals and only ate plants.
      </p>
      <p>
        These animals were herbivores with a simple diet. Their daily intake of
        food was limited to grasses. Along with water to drink, grass supplied
        all of the nourishment quaggas needed to survive. These picky eaters
        preferred to graze on tall grass as there was plenty more for the whole
        harem to eat than shorter grass pastures could provide. Grass is the
        main food source for other zebras as well. However, other species will
        also occasionally eat additional plant matter such as leaves and twigs,
        and sometimes snack on fruit.
