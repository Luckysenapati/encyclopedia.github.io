      <h2>Macaque Scientific Name :</h2>
      <p>
        The scientific name of the macaque genus is Macaca. This is the feminine
        form of macaco, meaning the Portuguese word for monkey. They belong to
        the family of Old World monkeys, along with baboons, doucs, and
        mandrills. There are more than 20 total species in the macaque genus.
      </p>
      <h2>Macaque Appearance :</h2>
      <p>
        The macaque is a medium-sized monkey, generally measuring up to 28
        inches and 40 pounds in size, with a somewhat long, rounded muzzle and
        nostrils located on the upper surface. The males are generally a lot
        larger than females, but otherwise, it can be difficult to tell them
        apart. The fur is usually some shade of brown or even black and thins
        out around the facial area. The arms are nearly the same size as the
        legs, making it easier to climb in trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these similarities, each species has its own unique
        characteristics. The lion-tailed macaque, for instance, has a massive
        white mane of hair surrounding its face, whereas the Celebes crested
        macaque has a black crest of hair on the top of the head, almost like a
        mohawk (this species was the subject of the famous smiling monkey selfie
        photo). The tail is another characteristic that varies widely; some
        species have exceptionally long tails, whereas in other species itâ€™s
        entirely absent.
      </p>
      <h2>Macaque Behavior :</h2>
      <p>
        The primary social unit of the macaque is the troop. Composed of several
        females, a few males, and their offspring (ultimately totaling a few
        dozen or even more than a hundred individuals), these troops are
        primarily defined by dominance hierarchies. The females generally form
        strong and long-lasting matrilineal hierarchies in which the dominance
        rankings are passed down from mother to daughter. The males also have a
        separate dominance ranking based mostly on strength, but it tends to
        shift more frequently as the males come and go from the troop. Young
        males in particular that donâ€™t belong to any particular troop may form
        their own separate bachelor groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hierarchy is extremely important because higher-ranked members have
        better access to food sources and mates. Group cohesion is generally
        maintained through familiar activities such as grooming. Physical
        contact is also a good way to reduce stress after a bad encounter.
        Females are more likely to groom each other, but males will also groom
        females in the mating season.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are numerous ways they communicate their mood and intentions with
        each other. An open-mouthed glare with a loud bark or screech conveys
        threat or aggression. This may be accompanied by branch shaking,
        lunging, or slapping the ground. Tail-up may indicate alertness or
        sexual presentation. Grunts, coos, and whimpers are all part of their
        verbal repertoire as well. In short, their behavior is incredibly
        complex and interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a relative of modern humans, itâ€™s no surprise that macaques are some
        of the cleverest animals on the planet. There are reports that
        crab-eating macaques use stone tools to open up nuts and shells. They
        also wash their food in the water to clean it. Some macaques in popular
        tourist destinations will steal food right from the hands of people, or
        theyâ€™ll steal objects and barter for tasty treats. In the wild, macaques
        spend a good deal of their time in the trees, searching for food and
        looking out for predators, but they also are equally as comfortable on
        the ground. They are great climbers, good runners, and even quite adept
        at swimming.
      </p>
      <h2>Macaque Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        Macaques are highly adaptable animals that live in a variety of
        different habitats, including urban settings next to people. Most are
        primarily found in tropical rainforests, mountains, or plains throughout
        Asia, but a single species, the Barbary macaque, is located in North
        Africa as well. The highest concentration of macaques (with some seven
        species) is found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Other species
        live in Taiwan, Japan, India, China, and Southeast Asia.
      </p>
      <h2>Macaque Predators and Threats :</h2>
      <p>
        These primates are facing enormous challenges from humans in the wild,
        including habitat loss and poaching. While they are capable of adapting
        to human-caused changes, many species cannot survive having their
        natural habitats fragmented and destroyed by farms, plantations, and
        towns.
