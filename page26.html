      <h2>Zebra Classification and Evolution :</h2>
      <p>
        The Zebra is a large species of equine that is natively found roaming
        the grassy plains of sub-Saharan Africa. They are the largest and most
        distinctive wild horses with bodies that are patterned with white and
        black stripes, the exact placement of which is unique to each
        individual. There are three different species of Zebra that are found in
        Africa which are the Common Zebra (also known as the Plains Zebra and
        the Burchell‚Äôs Zebra), the Grevy‚Äôs Zebra (also known as the Imperial
        Zebra) and the Mountain Zebra. Zebras are incredibly sociable animals
        that can travel vast distances in search of fresh grass and water but
        are severely threatened throughout much of their natural range due to
        increasing levels of human activity. Today, both the Grevy‚Äôs Zebra and
        the Mountain Zebra are considered to be endangered species and although
        the Common Zebra is more widespread and numerous, there have been sharp
        population declines in certain areas.
      </p>
      <h2>Zebra Anatomy and Appearance :</h2>
      <p>
        Zebras are heavy bodied animals that are perfectly designed for speed
        with their long and slender legs and narrow hooves helping them to reach
        speeds of 40kph when running. In the same way as horses, they only have
        a single toe on each foot which they walk on the tip of and is protected
        by their tough hooves. Their black and white stripes are unique to each
        individual and help them to identify each other when in the herd. Zebras
        have long necks and heads that mean they can easily reach the grass on
        the ground and a mane that extends from their forehead and along their
        back to the tail. The pattern of their stripes varies between the
        species with Grevy‚Äôs and Mountain Zebras having narrower stripes and
        white undersides, while the Common Zebra has broad stripes that cover
        its entire body. The Grevy‚Äôs Zebra is not only the largest of the Zebra
        species but is also easily identifiable by its large, rounded ears.
      </p>
      <h2>Zebra Distribution and Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        Zebras are animals that are found inhabiting the open grasslands and
        plains of East and Southern Africa where they spend almost of their time
        grazing on the grasses. The Common Zebra is the most numerous and has
        the widest natural range throughout East Africa where they are found
        roaming the grassy plains. The Mountain Zebra can be found grazing on
        the mountain grasslands of South-West Africa, while the Grevy‚Äôs Zebra is
        confined to the arid grasslands and sub-desert steppe throughout
        Ethiopia, Somalia and in northern Kenya. Zebras have evolved to run
        incredibly fast so they are able to escape from dangerous predators and
        so rely heavily on the open plains for their survival. Although the
        Common Zebra has been least affected, all three species of the animal
        are at risk from population declines due to the loss of their natural
        habitats caused by by increasing levels of human activity.
      </p>
      <h2>Zebra Behaviour and Lifestyle :</h2>
      <p>
        Zebras are highly sociable animals that roam the savanna in herds for
        protection from predators. The Grevy‚Äôs Zebra occupies herds more loosely
        than the other species with a stallion (male) patrolling enormous
        territories of up to 10 square kilometres, with mares (females) and
        their foals grazing freely and occasionally forming small groups that
        feed together. Both the Common Zebra and the Mountain Zebra inhabit
        their native regions in long-term herds that split into smaller family
        groups which are led by a dominant stallion and contain between one and
        six mares with their young. Their strong social bonds can make them very
        affectionate towards one another, often grooming each other using their
        teeth. During the mating season, males will fight fiercely for the right
        to breed with the females and do so by rearing up on their back legs
        whilst kicking and biting one another.
      </p>
      <h2>Zebra Reproduction and Life Cycles :</h2>
      <p>
        The Zebra is a relatively slow-developing mammal with females not being
        able to first breed until they are at least a few years old. After a
        gestation period that can last for between 10 months and a year, the
        female gives birth to a single foal that is born with its stripes, mane
        and also has a little patch of hair in the middle of its tummy. Zebra
        foals are able to stand within minutes of birth which is vital to ensure
        that they are able to run away to escape from predators. They are able
        to begin eating grass after a week and are weaned by the time they are
        11 months old. Young Zebras remain with their mother until they are
        mature at around three years old when the males leave their natal herd
        to join an all-male bachelor group, while females stay with their
        mother. These bachelor groups begin to challenge the dominant stallions
        to try and take over the harem during the mating season.
      </p>
      <h2>Zebra Diet and Prey :</h2>
      <p>
        The Zebra is a herbivorous animal meaning that it only eats plant-matter
        in order to gain the nutrition that it needs to survive. The majority of
        the Zebra‚Äôs diet (in fact around 90%) is comprised of a wide variety of
        different grasses with other plant matter including leaves and buds
        making up the rest. They use their sharp front teeth to nibble on the
        tough ends of grasses before grinding them up using the flat molars
        along its cheeks. Due to the fact that grass has little nutritional
        value, Zebras must spend between 60% and 80% of the day grazing. Common
        Zebras are often seen drinking at water holes which they do every day
        but, due to the fact that the Grevy‚Äôs Zebra and the Mountain Zebra
        inhabit drier, more arid regions, they often don‚Äôt drink for several
        days at a time. In the dry season Zebras can travel vast distances in
        search of fresh grass and water holes that haven‚Äôt yet dried up, with
        the Grevy‚Äôs Zebra also known to dig into the ground of dried up river
        beds to access the water underground. For a complete analysis of their
        diet, give our ‚ÄòWhat Do Zebras Eat?‚Äô page a read!‚Äù
      </p>
      <h2>Zebra Relationship with Humans :</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the free-roaming nature of Zebras and over vast distances, the
        increasing human presence throughout the world has meant that Zebras
        have been affected by the loss of their habitats throughout much of the
        natural range. However, one of the most intriguing things about Zebras
        to people is that because they are so closely related to other equines
        including Horses and Donkeys, Zebras has actually been able to breed
        with them to produce a hybrid foal, known as a Zonkey (Zebras and
        Donkeys) or as a Zorse (Zebras and Horses). Although it is not thought
        that the two species would naturally be able to mate in the wild due to
        geographical differences, a number of both Zonkey and Zorse individuals
        now exist around the world. Zebras are thought to have natural
        protection to certain parasites which has led people to breed Horses and
        Donkeys with Zebras to produce an animal that has the character and size
        of a Horse or Donkey but with the power and resilience of a Zebra. As
        with other cross-breed offspring though, Zonkeys and Zorses are
        infertile and so are unable to reproduce themselves.
