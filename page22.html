      <h2>Vampire Bat Anatomy and Appearance :</h2>
      <p>
        The Vampire Bat is quite a small animal, with itâ€™s body rarely growing
        larger than the size of a human thumb. Itâ€™s wings are long, finger-like
        bones that are covered in a thin layer of skin, with a thumb claw that
        pokes out of the front and is used for grip when clambering about on
        their host. Vampire Bats have dark brown to grey furry bodies with a
        lighter underside, and strong limbs which enable them to crawl about on
        the ground with ease. As with other Bats, Vampire Bats are animals that
        use echolocation in order to determine their surroundings. When flying,
        they produce high-pitched sounds that bounce of the objects in the area,
        and it is this bounced-back sound that allows the Bat to figure out
        where things are around them (it is so high-pitched that it cannot be
        heard by people).
      </p>
      <h2>Vampire Bat Distribution and Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        The Vampire Bat is found throughout the South American continent from
        Mexico to the tip of Argentina. Vampire Bats are found in both tropical
        and subtropical regions and can adapt to living in both humid and dry
        climates. Many Bats are nocturnal and the Vampire Bat is no exception,
        spending the daylight hours roosting in hollow trees, caves, mines and
        even derelict buildings in colonies that can be more than 1,000 strong.
        Although other Bat species are known to nest in the same places as the
        Vampire Bats, it is thought that the separate species tend to keep their
        distance from one another to avoid conflict.
      </p>
      <h2>Vampire Bat Behaviour and Lifestyle :</h2>
      <p>
        After sleeping upside in the darkness all day, Vampire Bats emerge when
        the moon appears in order to hunt for food. Despite being incredibly
        strong fliers, the design of their arms and legs means that they can
        also move about on the ground with surprising speed and agility. Vampire
        Bats fly about a meter above ground in search of a warm-blooded animal,
        and once found, they land close to it. The Vampire Bat then crawls up to
        itâ€™s generally sleeping victim, before biting it and feeding on the
        flowing blood. Vampire Bats tend to be solitary hunters but roost
        together in colonies that usually contain around 100 individuals, and
        contain alpha males and their harems of around 6 females, and their
        young.
      </p>
      <h2>Vampire Bat Reproduction and Life Cycles :</h2>
      <p>
        Vampire Bats mate all year round and are known to have a fairly long
        gestation period in comparison to other species of small tropical Bat.
        After between 3 and 4 months, the female Vampire Bat gives birth to a
        single baby which she cares for until it is weaned at between 3 and 5
        months of age (those bat babies born in captivity are weaned noticeably
        later, when they are 9 months old). As with other mammals, the young
        vampire bats feed on their motherâ€™s milk until they are old enough to
        consume an adult diet, and will not reach their full adult weight for
        roughly a year. Female Vampire Bats do appear to be very caring mothers,
        known to care for and adopt young orphans in the colony. Vampire Bats
        can live for up to 12 years in the wild, although captive individuals
        have been known to nearly reach the age of 20.
