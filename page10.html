      <h2>Where to Find the Jacana :</h2>
      <p>
        The jacana can be found in warm tropical locations all over the world,
        including Africa, southern Asia, Australia, Mexico and Central America,
        and South America. It also sometimes wanders as far north as the United
        States. They are specifically adapted to life in swamps, marshes,
        lagoons, and shallow lakes.
      </p>
      <h2>Scientific Name :</h2>
      <p>
        The scientific name of the jacana family is Jacanidae. This is derived
        from the name of the bird. The eight known species are divided into six
        different genera.
      </p>
      <h2>Size, Appearance, and Behavior :</h2>
      <p>
        The jacana is a medium-sized bird, measuring anywhere between six and 12
        inches tall. The most prominent feature to aid with identification is
        the long, spindly legs (the feet, toes, and claws look a bit like twigs
        and branches). These birds come in all manner of different colors,
        including brown, cinnamon, white, and black, sometimes accompanied by
        yellow or green flight feathers. Females can measure up to twice the
        size of the males, but their plumage is otherwise almost identical,
        making identification somewhat difficult. Some species also have little
        red wattles or crowns near the beak.
      </p>
      <p>
        The jacana is very well-adapted for the wetland ecosystem in which it
        lives. Their long legs and feet enable them to walk across lily pads and
        other floating vegetation without sinking. When threatened by a
        predator, they can stay underwater for long periods with the bill
        sticking above the surface to properly breathe. While they arenâ€™t
        capable of long, sustained, powerful flights, they do glide gently for
        short distances over the surface of the water. The feathers also provide
        insulation to keep the bird warm and comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The jacanaâ€™s social system appears to be fairly basic. They complete
        much of their foraging and hunting alone, but they do come together for
        breeding. These are also highly noisy birds that make a variety of
        different calls. Whether soothing a chick or spotting a predator, its
        verbal repertoire includes squeaks, whistles, cackles, coos, and
        twitters.
      </p>
      <h2>Diet :</h2>
      <p>The jacana is an omnivore, though much of what it consumes is meat.</p>
      <p>
        The jacana feeds mostly on small insects. It supplements this with
        snails, worms, crabs, fish, mollusks, and seeds. They use their beaks,
        toes, and claws to turn over aquatic vegetation in search of food.
      </p>
      <h2>Predators, Threats, and Conservation Status :</h2>
      <p>
        Seven of the eight species are classified by the IUCN Red List as least
        concern. Only the Madagascar jacana is endangered. The greatest threat
        is the loss of its natural wetland habitat to agriculture and livestock.
        Wetlands are some of the most vulnerable ecosystems on the planet.
      </p>
      <h2>Reproduction, Young, and Molting :</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most fascinating facts about the jacana is that it has
        evolved a polyandrous breeding relationship in which the female keeps
        multiple mates at a time rather than the opposite. Only the lesser
        jacana forms entirely monogamous breeding pairs. After mating, the
        female will produce a clutch of three or four eggs at a time. These
        glossy eggs have complex markings to help keep them safe and camouflaged
        among the vegetation. The father then assumes much of the responsibility
        of care, literally taking the eggs under his wing to keep them warm,
        while the female will often choose to mate again with another male to
        prepare the way for a new brood.
      </p>
      <p>
        After an incubation period lasting anywhere between 22 and 28 days, the
        babies will emerge from the eggs, fluffy and striped. They will soon
        learn how to walk, swim, and dive within the first few hours after
        hatching. The babies will continue to stay with the father and learn how
        to forage for about 40 to 70 days. If the nest starts to sink under the
        water, then he will take them to a new site under his wings. The
        lifespan of this bird is currently unknown. However, about half of the
        chicks do not survive into adulthood.
