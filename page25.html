      <h2>Yak Scientific Name :</h2>
      <p>
        Yak are members of the bovine family and are related to cows and
        buffalo, all of which are likely descended from aurochs, an extinct
        species of cattle. Yaks split from aurochs sometime between one million
        and five million years ago. Scientists classify the wild (Bos mutus) and
        domestic yaks (Bos grunniens) as two distinct species. The English word
        yak derives from the Tibetan word ‚Äúyag.‚Äù The scientific name of both
        species refers to the sounds or lack thereof that these animals make.
        Bos mutus, means mute ox, while Bos grunniens means grunting ox. They
        belong to Bovidae, the same family as the Asian water buffalo, the
        African buffalo and the American bison. The key difference between the
        two species is size, with wild males weighing up to two times more than
        their domestic counterparts. Domestic yaks are descended from the wild
        species.
      </p>
      <h2>Yak Appearance and Behavior :</h2>
      <p>
        All yaks are similar in appearance, although, as previously mentioned,
        wild yaks are larger. Wild yaks generally have darker, blackish to brown
        hair, while domestic species have wider color variations that include
        rusty brown and cream. All have warm, dense fur that hangs below their
        bellies and a wooly undercoat that covers their chest, flanks, and
        thighs. They have bulky frames and sturdy legs that end in rounded,
        cloven hooves. Their firm horns are also used for defense, allowing them
        to break through the snow in winter to find food buried beneath. Both
        males and females have a short neck with a pronounced hump over the
        shoulders, although this characteristic is more pronounced in males.
        They have tails that are long and look more like those of horses than of
        cable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Domesticated yaks are smaller as males generally weigh 600 to 1,100
        pounds, while females range from 400 to 600 pounds. Wild males can weigh
        as much as 2,200 pounds. The height of domestic males varies, but they
        generally top out at 44 to 54 inches at the withers, while females are
        41 to 46 inches at the withers. Females have four teats with an udder
        that is small and hairy. The same can be said of the male scrotum. The
        size and hairy coverings are protection against the cold.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wild yaks live in herds of several hundred animals, comprised primarily
        of females and their young with only a few males. Most males live on
        their own or live in smaller bachelor groups of about six until just
        before mating season when they will typically rejoin the larger herd.
        They generally avoid humans and may flee, although they can become
        aggressive when defending young or when in rut when males regularly
        fight amongst themselves to establish dominance. Typical rut behavior
        includes non-violent displays, along with attacks such as bellowing and
        scraping the ground with their horns. Bulls will also repeatedly charge
        at one another with their heads lowered or will spar with their horns.
        Males often wallow in dry soil during rut and scent-mark with urine or
        dung.
      </p>
      <h2>Yak Habitat :</h2>
      <p>
        Wild yaks are animals that live primarily in northern Tibet and the
        western Chinese province of Qinghai. Some populations extend into the
        southernmost parts of Xinjiang and India. Isolated populations of these
        animals are also spread throughout central Asia. Primary habitats are
        the treeless uplands of central Asia between 9,800 and 18,000 feet in
        mountain meadows and plateaus. They are commonly found in alpine tundra
        with thick grasses and sedges that provide their food. Some herds will
        migrate seasonally in search of food. They eat early in the morning and
        evening and don‚Äôt move about much, often sleep most of the day. During
        blizzards, these animals turn their tails into the storms and may remain
        motionless for hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to being bred for their milk, domestic yaks are raised for
        their butter, which is turned into po cha, or Tibetan butter tea.
        Tibetans make this tea by adding yak milk, butter, and salt to black tea
        from Pemagul to make the traditional drink, which fortifies drinkers
        against the Himalaya Mountains‚Äô thin, cold air. The tea is generally
        consumed by those living on plateaus above 17,000 feet. Yak butter plays
        a central role in the Butter Lamp Festival held during the first month
        of the Tibetan calendar in Lhasa. Monks spend months carving sculptures
        out of yak butter, while lamps burning the butter line the streets
        during the festival. Every summer, Tibetan nomads comb and process the
        soft, downy undercoat that yaks shed at this time of year. Coarse outer
        hair is turned into ropes, tents and wigs. The inner cashmere-like
        fibers are turned into textiles that have begun to rival traditional
        cashmere, made from Himalayan goat hair.
      </p>
      <h2>Yak Diet :</h2>
      <p>
        Yaks are herbivores, meaning they only eat plants. They spend a great
        deal of time in mountain meadows, grazing on grasses and other low-lying
        plants like sedges. Carex, Stipa, and Kobresia are among their favorite
        grasses. They also consume herbs, winter fat shrubs, moss, and lichen.
        Females like to graze on higher slopes than males, especially if they
        have young. They frequently drink during the summer and eat snow in the
        winter to stay hydrated. Like cows, they have two stomachs to
        efficiently extract all the nutrients out of the plants they eat.
      </p>
      <h2>Yak Predators and Threats :</h2>
      <p>
        Although domestic yaks are plentiful, the global population of yaks is
        dwindling and officially listed as vulnerable to extinction by the
        International Union for Conservation of Nature. In the early 1900s, wild
        yaks were hunted extensively by Tibetan and Mongolian herders and
        military personnel. Whereas only 50 years ago, as many as one million
        wild yaks roamed the Tibetan plateau, only about 10,000 remain today due
        to interbreeding with cows, loss of habitat, and poaching attacks by
        humans. Solitary males are particularly vulnerable to poaching.
        Disturbance by domestic livestock brings disease as well as
        interbreeding.
